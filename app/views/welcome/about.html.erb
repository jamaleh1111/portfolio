        <p>I have been learning and experimenting with Ruby and Rails since June 2015.  I studied online with a great mentor from <a href="https://bloc.io">Bloc</a>.  I had no experience in programming and now a new creative world has been opened up to me!  I am very excited about this new life changing endeavour and hope to keep honing and advancing my skills by learning more about front-end and UX/UI design.</p>
        <p>When Iâ€™m not programming I enjoy being with my family and friends, knitting, or trying to give back to the community.</p>
